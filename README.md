# remove-twitter-timeline
Firefox add-on that removes the timeline on Twitter

## Why should I use this add-on?

Twitter's black box algorithm creates a timeline of tweets that is optimized for engagement. It is designed to keep you on the site for as long as possible, creating a never-ending stream of information which favors super active users, shows tweets from unknown accounts just because someone you follow liked them, throws unnecessary promotions at you, etc. Infinitely scrolling this "curated" timeline is a waste of your time. So install this add-on and get your time back!

This add-on just removes the timeline, nothing else, so you can still use messages, lists and access notifications if you please.
